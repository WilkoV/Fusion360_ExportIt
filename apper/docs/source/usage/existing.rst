Adding apper to an existing project is not too difficult

Adding a Git Submodule
----------------------

The best way to leverage apper in your addin project is to use `Git Submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_

This way you can easily update to the latest version of apper
if it is enhanced

*Note: if you are using the Template files from HERE then this step is already done for you*

This assumes you already have your project in a `Git Repository <https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial>`_

Open a terminal and navigate to your addin's root directory:

You should be someplace like this:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ pwd

    /Users/rainsbp/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/FusionApperSample

Now add the submodule to your project:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/tapnair/apper
    Cloning into '/Users/rainsbp/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/FusionApperSample/apper'...

    remote: Counting objects: 100% (31/31), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (25/25), done.
    remote: Total 31 (delta 6), reused 29 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (31/31), done.

Status of a Git Submodule
-------------------------

To check the status of apper from the project root directory:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ git submodule status
    +e951ad1030b6ed8fb60db3bac7e1098d64289833 apper (remotes/origin/HEAD)

Update a Git Submodule
----------------------

As apper continues to be developed, the advantage of submodules is that you can always simply and easily updated the apper framework inside of your addin.

To update apper from the project root directory:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ git submodule update --remote
    remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 4 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
